# ASMA: A Stock Market Analyser
An Indian Stock Market Analyser built using Python.
---
<p> India's stock market is extremely variable and indeterministic, which has a limitless number of aspects that regulate the directions and trends of the stock market; therefore, predicting the uptrend and downtrend is a complicated process.
The objective of my Stock Market Analyser application (ASMA) is to provide investors with a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for analysing the stock market. I understand that investing in the stock market can be complex and challenging, especially for beginners. This application is designed to make the process of investing in the stock market more accessible and less intimidating for everyone. It will aim to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the stock market, as well as the tools and insights investors need to make informed decisions about their investments.
This application provides you with access to all the latest financial reports, announcements, and quarterly results for the stock you are interested in. You can download these reports and use them to make informed investment decisions.</p>
